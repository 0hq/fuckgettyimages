We're using Replicate.com to make an app that tells a story: a story about the end of human labor.   
We're doing image -> text prompt and then text prompt -> image generation. This gets around any legal stuff and creates a more interesting discussion: to what degree is the inspiration and the feeling of an image copyrightable? Is it illegal to use DALLE with a reference of a paid image and replicated it? Regardless, you can do this right now.
